# QM-EASyProducer
The EASy-Producer extensions for the QualiMaster project map selected classes from the QualiMaster infrastructure into EASy-Producer, in particular 
the Variability Instantiation Language (VIL) and its extension for runtime instantiation rt-VIL. This allows using concepts from the QualiMaster
infrastructure within these languages and to even simulate executions using the underlying implementations.

The implementation bridges the Maven nature of the QualiMaster infrastructure and the Eclipse nature of EASy-Producer. For using this extension, 
EASy-Producer (https://github.com/SSEHUB/EASyProducer) must be installed (either as source code or as release bundles).
